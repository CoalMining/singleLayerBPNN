The program is the ___Single hidden layer Neural Network implementation using BackPropagation___. <br />
The squashing function is currently ___sigmoid function___.<br />

Arguments:
----------
The argument passed are <br /> ./singleLayerBPNN [no of units in input layer][no of units in hidden layer][no of units in output layer]<br />
The ___default values___ is :<br /><br />
	no of units in input layer = 2<br />
	no of units in hidden layer = 4<br />
	no of units in output layer = 1<br />
	
Edit For Your Use:
------------------
For your use, you can change the input array or feed your own input entirely. Change the output also.<br />
Search for word ___"HERE"___ in the code to see the location that you need to change for input and output, but please make sure
	the dimension of input is equal to the number of units in input layer (No error checking is done for this)
