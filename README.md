The program is the single hidden layer Neural Network implementation using BackPropagation. 
The squashing function is currently sigmoid function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The argument passed are ./singleLayerBPNN [no of units in input layer][no of units in hidden layer][no of units in output layer]
The default values is :
	no of units in input layer = 2
	no of units in hidden layer = 4
	no of units in output layer = 1
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For your use, you can change the input array or feed your own input entirely. Change the output also
Search for word "HERE" in the code to see the location that you need to change for input and output, but please make sure
	the dimension of input is equal to the number of units in input layer (No error checking is done for this)
